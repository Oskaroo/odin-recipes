    <h1>Grandma's Polish Perogies</h1>
    <img src="../photos/perogiesphoto.jpg" alt ="perogies photos">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The recipe has been in the family for generations, with a few alterations of course!" Serve with a drizzling of butter or a dollop of sour cream.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Dough</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>42 cups sour cream</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling</h3>
    <li>8 baking potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
    <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons processed cheese sauce</li>
    <li>1 pinch onion salt, or to taste</li>
    <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the dough: Stir together flour and salt in a large bowl. Whisk together sour cream, eggs, egg yolk, butter, and oil in a separate bowl. Stir the wet ingredients into the flour until well blended and the dough comes together. Cover the bowl with a towel, and let stand for 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, prepare the filling: Place potatoes into a pot, and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until tender, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain potatoes, and mash with shredded cheese and cheese sauce while still hot. Season with onion salt, salt, and pepper. Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Separate pierogi dough into two balls. Roll out one ball at a time on a lightly floured surface until it is thin enough to work with, but not too thin so that it tears, between 1/8- and 1/4-inch thick. Cut into circles using a cookie cutter, pierogi cutter, or a glass, 3- to 4-inches in diameter.</li>
        <li>Assemble the perogies: Brush a little water around the edges of the circles, and spoon some filling into the center. Fold the circles over into half-circles, and press to seal the edges with fingers, or use a fork for crimped edges.</li>
        <li>Place perogies on a cookie sheet, and freeze. Once frozen, transfer to freezer storage bags or containers.</li>
        <li>To cook the perogies: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Lower perogies into the water in batches. Cook until they float to the top, about 5 minutes. Do not boil too long, or they will be soggy. Remove with a slotted spoon.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <p>For best results, choose potatoes that have as little water in them as possible such as russets.

        Choose a rolling pin that is very heavy — it will be easier to roll out the dough.
        
        The perogies are less likely to burst during cooking if they are frozen when you put them in the boiling water.</p>
